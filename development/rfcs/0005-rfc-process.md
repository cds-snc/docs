# RFC Process

## Summary

This RFC lays out some foundations for the RFC process, mostly around
the approval and acceptance process.

## Motivation

Without some sort of framework it is difficult to know how the RFC
process is going to work and to align everyone in the same direction.
There are questions around when approvals are needed, how many, how long
do we wait. This RFC attempts to set some guardrails for this process
and to start us in the right direction.

## Proposal

1. The [proposal template](../rfc-template.md) lays out the typical proposal
   structure.
2. A proposal from PR announcement to commit MUST be no less then 2 weeks.
   The announcement MUST be in Slack on the appropriate channels for the
   RFC content.
3. An RFC MUST have approval from two reviewers to commit.
   - Preferably one of the approvers will be the Head of Community.
   - Approvers should work towards approval. If you disagree with a given
     RFC are there modifications that can be made to make it agreeable?
   - Approval maybe conditional on changes to the RFC (a 'yes if' approval).
4. If there is someone uniquely positioned to review the RFC that person
   MUST be added for approval, this may extend the wait period outside
   the 2 weeks if the required approver is on vacation or leave.

## Drawbacks

Adding too much process will make the RFC process more heavy weight.
We'd like the whole system to be as light as possible, but still be
usable by the community. Adding too many rules may sway folks off
creating/maintaining RFCs.

## Alternatives

A ad-hoc approach could be used but this gets confusing without
understanding who is responsible to move RFCs forward, and how to move them
forward.

## Open Questions

1. What about other communities?

We decided to focus on the developer community to start. If we find this
process is working well and adopted through the developer community then we
can discuss using RFCs with other communities at CDS. This proposal will then
be modified or replaced as necessary.

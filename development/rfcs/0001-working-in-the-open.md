# Working in the open

## Summary

This document attempts to set out a structured way of 'working in the open',
such that we can illustrate more of the decision making process that goes into
how we work at CDS. This will serve as a guide for ongoing product development
but also as a way for new CDSers to understand why we made technical decisions.
This also lays out for the broader Government of Canada how and why we came to
the conclusions we have.

This is not a perfect solution. We welcome all feedback, questions, and comments
on our practices, and ask that you simply respect that working in the open is a
challenging process.

For this document, 'we' refers to the CDS developer community.

## Motivation

We work in the open as we value transparency and we want to build trust and
confidence in how we work.

We build on the work of others -- [‘Make things open: it makes them better’](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/).
This RFC repository is based of the GOV.UK example. This RFC is based off of
the [COVID Alert Working in the Open RFC](https://github.com/cds-snc/covid-alert-documentation/blob/7e81c69a80d8f424b2e45eac8b71d24738b3f0ce/rfc/0001-working-in-the-open.md).

## Proposal

We currently have data across our internal document repositories, posted on
the [CDS website](digital.canada.ca) and, in some cases, in developers heads. We
intend to use the RFC process, the associated `projects`, `discussions` and
`issues` to move more of this information into the open by default, adjusting how
the developer community works accordingly.

Individual projects will continue to use their existing mechanisms and
repositories.

We encourage our team members to work in the language of their choice, and to
ensure that they respond to community members in the language of their
choosing. High level items such as road maps, product features, and documentation
should be available in both languages. If you notice areas that are not, feel
free to raise them with us and we will do our best to resolve the issue as
quickly as possible.

## Drawbacks

This is a substantial shift from how the CDS developer community currently. This
will require convincing developers that creating the RFCs, and having
discussions on them is a worthwhile endeavor. There will also be an initial lift
as the internal documents are ported into RFCs and placed in this repository.

## Alternatives

We've been working in ad-hoc internal document repositories and various other
systems but it has quickly become difficult to find the most up-to-date
information on our practices and procedures. This system could be redesigned
and re-architected to house our documents, keeping the decisions closed.

This has the downside of losing the opportunity to build trust and confidence in
the way CDS works and we miss out on the opportunity to provide other public
servants the visibility into how we approach development through all its various
stages.

## Open Questions

- For existing information to be placed in this repository should it go through
  the full review process?
  - I think this is a yes, as we can update the prior documents as we move
    forward.

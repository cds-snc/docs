# Values

## Summary
This RFC records the overall CDS values. These are the same as seen in <link to
public values page>. They are replicated here to make them easier to surface to
the developer community.


## Motivation
The list of values are why we work. They lay out the ground work for our mission
to change government to serve people better. They guide us on the decisions we
make and the projects we take on and how we work on those projects.


## Proposal

### Put people at the heart of services
Our work is fundamentally about people, not technology. We’re driven by empathy
and put people’s needs first. We build inclusivity, diversity, and accessibility
into everything we do —- from the start, not as an afterthought. We work hand in
hand with the people who use and operate services.

### Deliver measurable outcomes
We work to achieve the greatest impact for the greatest number of people in the
greatest need. That means we focus on measuring how we help people and create
lasting change in government, not project milestones. We believe hands-on
delivery -— actually designing and building services with partners —- develops
skills and gets results.

### Do the hard work to make things easier
Making change in government is hard, but we love a good challenge. We do not shy
away from hard conversations but approach them with courage, humility,
compassion, and integrity. We untangle complexity so the people using government
services do not have to. 

### Build for learning and iteration
Great services are built in small steps and modular parts that make it easier to
pivot and course correct. The best way to find out if a service works well is to
put it in front of the people who use it, so we continuously test, learn,
document, and adjust.

### Work in the open to help clear a path
We share our work, progress, and failures to help others learn from what we do.
We want to show what is possible and empower public servants to make it a
reality. We welcome the contributions and critiques that make our work better.

### Take care of each other
We’ve got each other’s backs -— and those of our partners. We treat resilience
and wellness as organizational responsibilities, not just character traits. We
work to create a space where people feel they belong, take risks, learn from
mistakes, and speak openly.

# Principles

## Summary
This RFC lays out the guiding principles for the developer community at CDS.
These principles guide how we work, what we work on and why we choose projects.


## Motivation
In order to better work with each other and the rest of CDS it's good to lay out
the guiding principles of the community. These principles serve as guide posts
for the current community but also serve as a foundation for new CDS employees
to understand how we work.


## Proposal
1. Optimize for outcomes
  - Make decisions and build things that help the people served by the GC.
  - Focus actions on working and exploring the things that matter most.
  - Constantly be triaging and prioritizing work
2. Do just enough, right now
  - Do the minimum of what’s needed to test ideas
  - Create momentum by shipping often
  - Be agile
  - Always work towards the Minimal Viable Product
3. Bring people with you
  - Build shared understanding
  - Co-build with your team and users
  - Get and give feedback
  - Ask for help when needed
4. Always be learning, building, and adapting
  - Build from research and research what you build
  - Don’t wait long to start building
  - Don’t be afraid to throw away what’s been done
  - Share what you learn, so the whole team benefits
5. Create inclusive and accessible services that are designed for the edges
  - Research with people with disabilities
  - Support inclusive service delivery.
  - Usability, inclusive design and accessibility by design


## Drawbacks
As with all principles we need to be careful they don't become too restrictive.
We don't want the community to get stuck in a given way of working, but to
continue to adapt and grow. This can be mitigated by reviewing these principles
on a periodic basis and determine if any adjustments are needed.

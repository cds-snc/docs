# Accessibility and Inclusion

## Summary
CDS is committed to building accessible and inclusive services. Building
accessible services means accommodating everyone’s needs. From the start, we
work with the people who will use a product, including people with disabilities.
We work across all disciplines — blurring the lines between research,
development, design, and accessibility.

Inclusivity is a high priority in all of our work. Ensuring that everyone can
interact with our services in a way that meets their individual needs and
promotes their independence and dignity is important to us. Our goal is to make
it better than it was yesterday.


## Motivation
We build services for anyone that wants to interact with the Canadian
Government which, by its nature, includes people who require the accessibility
features of our sites. In order to meet our mission we MUST build accessibility
and inclusivity into our software.

Further, the [Government of Canada Standard on Web Accessibility](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601)
and the [Accessible Canada Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/accessible-people-disabilities/act-summary.html)
require sites to be accessible and to meet certain
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
standards.


## Proposal
 * Accessibility is everyones job, champion accessibility efforts in your work
 * Put people first.
   * Products MUST follow inclusive design principles to provide equal access to
     humans with diverse abilities.
   * Provide choice and flexibility to accommodate peoples needs.
   * There are no average or 'normal' users.
 * Build for accessibility and inclusivity from the start.
   * Accessibility MUST be built into our products from the first commit,
     not tagged on at the end.
   * People with disabilities SHOULD be consulted in user research, design, and
     testing of services.
 * Use plain language to ensure that content is clear.
 * Provide way-finding &mdash; help people navigate to relevant content
 * Products MUST be build to standards.
   * The [Canadian Government Standard on Web Accessibility](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601) requires meeting all 5 [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
   requirements.
   * Products SHOULD work to exceed a WCAG 2.1 AA rating.
 * Developers MUST test for accessibility throughout the development cycle.
   * Services and tools to build accessibility automation SHOULD be run by
     your integration servers. (Note, these services can only find ~15-50% of
     issues, manual testing is critical)
   * Use the [how to make it accessible](https://digital.canada.ca/a11y/how-to-make-it-accessible/)
     guide to determine your priorities.
 * Teams SHOULD plan and execute periodic accessibility audits with the CDS
   accessibility team.


## Alternatives
Compared to building accessibility and inclusion in from the start, it could be
added into the project at the end. Once the major functionality is in place,
start enabling accessibility and inclusion controls. This has the major drawback
in that it adds a lot of work at the end of the project, and it doesn't set the
mindset of developers to be thinking about accessibility as the site is built.
There is the large potential that parts of the site will be difficult to make
accessible and will greatly increase the cost of something that could have been
caught earlier.
